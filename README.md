# Homebrew Binary
These formulae provide binary installs of software that, for whatever reason, aren't available as source builds in the primary repository.

## How do I install these formulae?
`brew install homebrew/binary/<formula>`

Or `brew tap homebrew/binary` and then `brew install <formula>`.

Or install via URL (which will not receive updates):

```
brew install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/homebrew-binary/master/<formula>.rb
```

## Documentation
`brew help`, `man brew` or check [Homebrew's documentation](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/tree/master/share/doc/homebrew#readme).
